This repository contains some of my personal GitHub CI experiments as well some snap packaging tests.

My snap `test-2bc233c04d9b-locnnil` is the target for the experiments, currently unlisted under:
https://snapcraft.io/test-2bc233c04d9b-locnnil

It doesn't do nothing usefull. It just exists for me to test some snap store interactions.
